# Lab 5: Vulnerability Scanners

Estimated Time: 100 Mins
___

In this lab we’ll look have our first look at using vulnerability scanners. We'll look at two of the most popular free options, Nessus & OpenVAS. You should try out both and decide on your scanner of choice, you'll need a vulnerability scanner setup for your practical exam and you should be familar with how it works.

___


## In this lab we will: 

In this lab we will:
1.	Vulnerabilities 101: Understand the flaws of an application and apply your researching skills on some vulnerability databases.
2.	Learn how to set up and use Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner.
3.	Learn the basics of threat and vulnerability management using Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanning
4.	Scanning Metasploitable 1

### 5.1 Vulnerabilities 101: Understand the flaws of an application and apply your researching skills on some vulnerability databases.

The hacks that we hear about in newspapers are from exploiting vulnerabilities. In this section, we're going to explain exactly what a vulnerability is, the types of vulnerabilities and how we can exploit these for success in our penetration testing endeavours.

### 5.2 Learn how to set up and use Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner.

Nessus vulnerability scanner is exactly what you think is its! A vulnerability scanner! It uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at. Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn't make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.

### 5.3 Learn the basics of threat and vulnerability management using Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanning


Check out the Censys.io website and some their demos and case studies, and try perform some of the same tasks that you performed during the earlier Shodan exercises, explore the site and try get an understanding of the capabilities on offer. Check out the query syntax help section on the Censys site to get a better understanding of the full power and option available.

> ❗ For the next few sections, we’ll very briefly introduce a few different tools, you should spend some time learning these tools.


### 5.4 Scanning Metasploitable 1

Discovering domain names, public-facing websites, and email addresses is an important part of footprinting an organization during an assessment. Pentesters are able to gather public information about organisations, computer systems, and who they belong to. Querying information about the organisation’s domain is the first step in the process. The WHOIS directory service was developed
