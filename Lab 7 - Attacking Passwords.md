### 7.3 Cracking windows and linux password hashes

Old end of life products tend to always be vulnerable and obviously shouldn't appear on a live network because of the risks associated with such systems. Your instructor will show a walkthrough of exploiting a legacy windows XP system. If you'd like to attempt the same demo you can find the a Windows XP image and key, on the module resources section on Brightspace.
