# Lab 5: Vulnerability Scanners

Estimated Time: 100 Mins
___

In this lab we’ll look have our first look at using vulnerability scanners. We'll look at two of the most popular free options, Nessus & OpenVAS. You should try out both and decide on your scanner of choice, you'll need a vulnerability scanner setup for your practical exam and you should be familar with how it works.

___


## In this lab we will: 

In this lab we will:
1.	Vulnerabilities 101: Understand the flaws of an application and apply your researching skills on some vulnerability databases.
2.	Learn how to set up and use Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner.
3.	Learn the basics of threat and vulnerability management using Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanning
4.	Scanning Metasploitable 1

___


### 5.1 Vulnerabilities 101: Understand the flaws of an application and apply your researching skills on some vulnerability databases.

The hacks that we hear about in newspapers are from exploiting vulnerabilities. In this section, we're going to explain exactly what a vulnerability is, the types of vulnerabilities and how we can exploit these for success in our penetration testing endeavours.

### 5.2 Learn how to set up and use Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner.

Nessus vulnerability scanner is exactly what you think is its! A vulnerability scanner! It offer both a free and paid version and is a popular choice by pentesters. It uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at. Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn't make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.

### 5.3 Learn the basics of threat and vulnerability management using Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanning

An alternative to Nesus is OpenVAS, an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. Probably not as robust a scanner as Nessus, its still a popular choice maibnly because its complete free. This is not an end all be all solution but can help to get rid of any common vulnerabilities that may have slipped through the cracks.

> ❗ You should pick one of the two scanners above as your vulnerability scanner of choice. Other options often used by students including Nmaps vulnerabilty scripts or Nikto are not full vulnerability scanners and aren't suitable for use on their own. You'll loose marks in your practical if you dont use a full vulnerbility scanner.


### 5.4 Scanning Metasploitable 1

For this last section you'll need to performa vulnerability scan of our Metasploitable VM using both Nessus and OpenVAS and compare the results of both scanners.

> ❗ You should have Metasploitable 1 setup from our previous online session, if you havent already got the VM setup, check out the video on Brightspace and a quick walkthrough in setting up the VM.
