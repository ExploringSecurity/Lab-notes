## In this lab we will: 

In this lab we will:
1. Metasploit introduction
2. Metasploit demo against metasploitable 1
3. Metasploit demo against windows 
4. Using metasploit to exploit the Eternal Blue Windows vulnerability.

___


### 6.1 Metasploit introduction

###Â 6.3 Metasploit demo against windows 

Old end of life products tend to always be vulnerable and obviously shouldn't appear on a live network because of the risks associated with such systems. Your instructor will show a walkthrough of exploiting a legacy windows XP system. If you'd like to attempt the same demo you can find the a Windows XP image and key, on the module resources section on Brightspace.
